Norwwegian  Breweries
=====================

DEPERECATED!!

I've realized that it's too much hassle to keep this repo up-to-data and decided to put my efforts into updating the breweries at OpenStreetMap instead. This means that this repo is out of sync

Take a look at https://gist.github.com/atlefren/60234fb68d8299136c05 for details on how to update OpenStreetmap


A GeoJSON file with position and basic info about norwegian breweries.

The GeoJSON file was made by converting the KML file used by http://olportalen.no/bryggerikart/, compiled by  Erik Dahl, usage terms unknown.

Some modifications where made (formatting, case, spelling) and some websites was added.


Update
